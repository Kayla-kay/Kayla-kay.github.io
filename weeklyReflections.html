        <h1>Weekly Reflections</h1>
        <h3>Course Introduction</h3>
        <p>This week was fairly simple. I think that the most difficult part of online classes is orienting myself to find all of the assignments and information (since each teacher organizes things a little differently this can sometimes be confusing). I enjoyed getting to know the software a little bit more, even though I’ve used quite a bit of it previously. I’m not 100% fluent in any of it, but I understand how most of it works and can get the basic understanding from it. I’m excited for the opportunity to use this course to continue to grow in those skills.</p>
        <h3>Lesson 01</h3>
        <p>This week was actually quite a fun week. I did some brainstorming for the app that I want to create, and I came up with a lot of really interesting ideas. The more I looked into what each might need and how the data going into it would affect my overall project, I was able to narrow down my ideas until I had one that I thought would be good to learn from but that would also be interesting and fun to work on. The artistic aspect has always been my favorite, so I’m enjoying the process of brainstorming and coming up with ways to combine both the development of an app with the design of one.</p>
        <h3>Lesson 02</h3>
        <p>Communication is really important. If you have to make a schedule change for a meeting or if we need to set a time to meet, please do it early rather than a few hours beforehand. It makes it really difficult to coordinate and get things done when we are all depending on one another if there is a lack of communication. And since this is an online class and our collaboration is all based on virtual chats and emailing it's even more important that everyone stay on top of the communication and coordination of meetings. </p>
        <p>Communication is something that I’m really worried about for this class because I can’t be flexible with my schedule unless I’m told ahead of time what my team needs and wants to see happen during the week. I hope that things work out and the semester will go smoothly.</p>
        <h3>Lesson 03</h3>
        <p>This week I was working on learning coding for JSON and Javascript. It was really confusing most of the time, but I found a <a href=http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp target="_blank">resource</a> that made it a lot easier to understand Javascript Objects. After going through the examples and information, I understood the coding a lot better.</p>
        <h3>Lesson 04</h3>
        <p>I realized that I have a textbook on Javascript basics. I don’t remember what class I got it for, but it’s really helpful in understanding how some of the codes work! :) If you want a good textbook on Java, I would recommend getting <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Java-Beginners-Guide-Herbert-Schildt/dp/0071809252/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431716060&sr=8-1&keywords=java+a+beginners+guide+herbert target="_blank">this</a> one.</p>
        <h3>Lesson 05</h3>
        <p>Team work is super important. I’ve noticed than when I’ve been working with the information that I’ve received from my teammates that I’ve been able to do a much better job of understanding what the objectives for our project are. Things usually tend to go much better when I’m working with a team.</p>
        <h3>Lesson 06</h3>
        <p>I don't know if I should put this here or under the CSS discussion board. I found this super cool <a href=http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ target="_blank">link</a> which basically has a bazillion different animation styles. It's hosted through github, too, so you can download the information and play with the code yourself! :) </p>
        <h3>Lesson 07</h3>
        <p>I’ve really been liking the w3schools website. It’s super helpful for figuring out the basics of some of the coding, and I love that I can play with the examples and create my own code from theirs right on the webpage. </p>
        <h3>Lesson 08</h3>
        <p>The power of teamwork is incredible! We started talking as a team, and we started working together from the very first day to determine what we wanted our project to be. Once we had started the ball rolling it didn’t take much to keep it in motion. We worked together each week to learn the topics that we need to use, and we divided up the code that we learned so that we could get our app built. By starting early and splitting up the work as a team we’ve been able to get really far along with our app. If we hadn’t done so we would all be stressed out and frustrated.</p>
        <h3>Lesson 09</h3>
        <p>I have been having a little bit of a struggle keeping up this week and getting the combinations of code to work the way that I’ve really wanted them to. It’s been really helpful to use internet resources to figure out where I’ve made mistakes and how to fix them. I’ve found that YouTube videos have been really helpful as well. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbB3lVyUvAM target="_blank">Here</a>’s one that has a really good explanation of how JSON works.</p>
        <h3>Lesson 10</h3>
        <p>This week, I’ve had to do a lot of code on my team’s app. I feel like when we get into the more stressful parts of the semester our communication goes out the window and everyone is doing things differently. This makes it really difficult to get everything done as quickly as we otherwise would be able to. Don’t forget to be patient and keep working together as we enter the last part of the semester!</p>
        <h3>Lesson 11</h3>
        <p>The closer we get to the end of the semester, the more stressful things get. It’s made me extremely grateful that we’ve been working in teams because we’ve been able to work together by dividing up the content of our app, and we’ve gotten a lot further together than I think I ever would have been able to do on my own. It’s really frustrating sometimes because we have scheduling conflicts and sometimes our communication isn’t very good, but overall it’s been really nice to be able to work in teams!</p>
